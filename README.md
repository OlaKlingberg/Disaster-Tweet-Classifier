# Disaster Tweet Classifier

This project was made for Module 4 of the course *Introduction to Deep Learning* (DTSA-5511) at University of Colorado Boulder. It is related to the Kaggle competition [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started).

The project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline to classify tweets as disaster-related or not. Using both LSTM and DistilBERT models, it explores preprocessing text data, building and training classification models, and evaluating performance with metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. The notebook also includes K-fold cross-validation and visualizes results with detailed plots.

Key highlights:
* Implementation of LSTM and DistilBERT architectures for binary classification.
* Handling imbalanced datasets with class weights and cross-validation.
* Custom callbacks for tracking metrics and visualization of model performance.
* Comparative analysis of model architectures to identify the most effective approach.

This project showcases practical skills in natural language processing (NLP) and model evaluation, relevant for tasks in text classification and social media analysis.
