# Disaster Tweet Classifier

This project was made for Module 4 of the course *Introduction to Deep Learning* (DTSA-5511) at University of Colorado Boulder. The task was based on the Kaggle competition [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started).

The project demonstrates the use of machine-learning models to classify tweets as disaster-related or not. The models explored are **LSTM** and **DistilBERT**. The performance is evaluated using K-fold cross-validation, and metrics such a precision, recall, and F1-score are plotted.

Key highlights:
* Implementation of **LSTM** and **DistilBERT** architectures for binary classification.
* Handling imbalanced datasets with class weights.
* Custom callbacks for tracking metrics and visualization of model performance.
* Comparative analysis of model architectures.

This project showcases practical skills in natural language processing (NLP) and model evaluation, relevant for tasks in text classification and social media analysis.
